# Shift Cipher

## Overview
Welcome to the Shift Cipher project! This web application allows users to encode and decode messages using a Shift (Caesar) cipher technique. By entering a key (a positive or negative integer between -25 and 25), users can easily transform their messages by shifting the letters accordingly.

## Features
- Encode Messages: Transform plain text into encoded text using a specified shift value.
- Decode Messages: Revert encoded text back to its original form using the same shift value.
- User-Friendly Interface: Simple HTML/CSS layout for easy interaction.
- Dynamic Input Handling: Immediate feedback on encoding/decoding results.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
To run this project, you need:
- A modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, etc.)

### Installation
1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/407proxy/shift-cipher.git`
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd shift-cipher`
3. Open `index.html` in your web browser.

## Usage
1. Enter a key value (an integer between -25 and 25) in the designated input field.
2. Type your message in the message input area.
3. Click on the "Encode" button to encode your message or the "Decode" button to decode it.
4. The result will be displayed below the buttons.

## Example
- Key: 3
- Original Message: HELLO
- Encoded Message: KHOOR (each letter is shifted by 3 positions)
